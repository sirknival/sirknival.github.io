Interested in robotics, scouts, adventures, running and primarily in mountains.
**Thinks in oeuvres.**

I am a student in **Robotics and Automation** with a strong interest in control systems, applied mathematics, and innovative engineering solutions.  

Beyond my studies, I am actively engaged in volunteering and teamwork through the scouting movement, which has shaped my values of responsibility, collaboration, and lifelong learning.
