If you run 1km on the first of the month, 2km on the 2nd of the month and so on. Eventually (on a month with 31 days) you’ll run a total of 496km. 
It’s that simple.

But maybe on day 14 you decide to boost your weekly volume. You add 30 km to all daily distances up to day 5—except for days 1 and 2. Doing the challenge in a 30-day month, this means day 1 gets skipped, while day 2 grows into a 42 km run—the answer to everything.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
